Video Explanation for Comparing and Contrasting, as well as the proving of the notation for Big O, Big Theta, and Big Omega that was written on the board, but I have corrected some part, I'm not sure if what is written is wrong or its just the quality of my camera.

This repository contains Python Codes for the following:
1) Big O

def big_o_example(n):
    for i in range(n):
        print(i)


2) Big Theta

def big_theta_example(n):
    for i in range(n): 
        print(i)

3) Big Omega

def big_omega_example(arr, target):
    if arr[0] == target:
        return True
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):  
        if arr[i] == target:
            return True
    return False
